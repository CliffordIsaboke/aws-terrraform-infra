# 🏗️ Terraform AWS Infrastructure

This project contains a **Terraform configuration** for deploying a **multi-tier application infrastructure** on **AWS**.
The architecture includes:

* 🖥️ **Compute layer** — Amazon ECS (Fargate)
* 💾 **Database layer** — Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache
* 🌐 **Networking & Security** — VPC, IAM, Security Groups, and compliance tools

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each module is responsible for a distinct part of the infrastructure:

| Module            | Description                                           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **`networking/`** | VPC, subnets, route tables, and NAT gateways          |
| **`compute/`**    | ECS cluster, services, and auto-scaling configuration |
| **`database/`**   | RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache resources              |
| **`security/`**   | IAM roles, security groups, and compliance setup      |
| **`cicd/`**       | CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild   |
| **`monitoring/`** | CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and centralized logging       |

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

* 🧰 [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) **v1.6+**
* ☁️ [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* 🔑 [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with sufficient permissions

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd terraform-aws-infra
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Configure Variables

Update `variables.tf` files within each module to match your environment and preferences.

### 4. Plan the Deployment

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. Apply the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

### 6. Access Outputs

After deployment, Terraform will output key details such as:

* Public **ALB DNS**
* **ECS service name**
* **RDS endpoint**
* **Redis endpoint**

## 🧩 Modules Overview

| Module         | Function                                             |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Networking** | Creates VPC, subnets, route tables, and NAT gateways |
| **Compute**    | Deploys ECS services and auto-scaling configuration  |
| **Database**   | Provisions RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache            |
| **Security**   | Sets up IAM roles, security groups, and compliance   |
| **CI/CD**      | Automates deployments via CodePipeline & CodeBuild   |
| **Monitoring** | Adds CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and logging integration |

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

This configuration includes:

* **AWS Config** and **Security Hub** for compliance monitoring
* **CloudTrail** for audit logging
* Security group and IAM best practices baked into each module

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization

Designed with cost efficiency in mind:

* Uses **Fargate Spot Instances** where applicable
* Implements **S3 lifecycle rules** for log storage management
* Modular structure allows scaling individual components as needed

### 🧠 Tip

For best results, use a **remote backend** (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB lock table) for state management in a team environment.

Would you like me to style it specifically for **GitHub dark mode** (with emojis and color-safe headers) or make a **corporate-style version** (minimal emojis, more formal tone)? I can format it accordingly.
